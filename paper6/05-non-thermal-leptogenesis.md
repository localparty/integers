# 5. Non-Thermal Leptogenesis

*This section is unique to Paper 6.*

## 5.1 The Problem

Standard thermal leptogenesis (Fukugita & Yanagida 1986) requires
the heavy right-handed neutrinos N_i to be thermally produced:
T_reh > M_N. For the framework's M_N ~ 10¹⁴ GeV and
T_reh ~ 5 × 10⁹ GeV, this condition is NOT satisfied. The neutrinos
cannot be produced in the thermal bath.

But the baryon asymmetry η_B ≈ 6 × 10⁻¹⁰ must be produced somehow.
The inflaton provides the pathway through off-shell non-thermal
production.

## 5.2 Non-Thermal Production of Bulk Neutrinos

During the first few oscillations of the inflaton around its
potential minimum, the field amplitude is large — the inflaton
sweeps through field values where its effective energy exceeds 2M_N.
At these moments, the inflaton can produce bulk neutrino pairs
through the parametric resonance mechanism (Kofman, Linde &
Starobinsky 1997):

    a_G(t) oscillating → coherent production of N_i N_i pairs

The production is efficient when:

    q ≡ (σ M_N² φ_0)/(m_inf² M_Pl) > 1

where φ_0 is the initial oscillation amplitude. For the first
oscillation (φ_0 ~ φ_end ~ several × M_Pl):

    q ~ (1/√3) × (10¹⁴)² × M_Pl / (10¹³)² / M_Pl
      ~ (1/√3) × 10²⁸/10²⁶
      ~ 58

**q ≫ 1** — the production is in the broad resonance regime.

## 5.2a Off-Shell Production Rate for φ → N_i N_i

Since 2M_N > m_inf, the bulk neutrinos cannot be produced by
two-body decay of the inflaton at rest. However, during the first
few oscillations after inflation, the inflaton has a broad coherent
oscillation with amplitude φ_0 ~ M_Pl, and the off-shell production
rate can be estimated using the non-thermal production formula from
Giudice, Notari, Raidal, Riotto & Strumia (2003), hereafter GNRRS.

For an inflaton oscillating with amplitude φ_0 and frequency m_inf,
the parametric resonance production rate for off-shell N pairs is
(GNRRS eq. 2.18):

    Γ_N ~ (h² m_inf / 8π) × (M_N²/m_inf²) × F(2M_N/m_inf)

where h is the effective Yukawa coupling of the inflaton to N, and
F(x) is a kinematic suppression factor for off-shell production.
For x = 2M_N/m_inf ~ 20 (our case: M_N ~ 10¹⁴ GeV, m_inf ~ 10¹³ GeV),
the off-shell factor F ~ (1/x)⁴ ~ 10⁻⁵ from the virtual propagator,
combined with the parametric resonance enhancement q^{1/4} ~ 58^{1/4}
~ 2.8.

The effective branching ratio:

    Br(inf → N_i N_i)_eff ~ (M_N/m_inf)² × F(2M_N/m_inf) × (resonance enhancement)
                           ~ (10¹⁴/10¹³)² × 10⁻⁵ × 2.8
                           ~ 100 × 10⁻⁵ × 2.8
                           ~ 2.8 × 10⁻³

This confirms Br ~ 10⁻³–10⁻² for the off-shell non-thermal
production. The factor of ~3 difference from the earlier estimate
Br ~ 10⁻² is within the accuracy of this parametric resonance
calculation; a more precise computation would require numerical
integration of the inflaton equation of motion during the first
oscillation.

## 5.3 The Lepton Asymmetry

Each bulk neutrino N_i decays to lepton–Higgs pairs on BOTH branes
(Paper 2, Appendix E):

    N_i → l_L + H     (visible brane)
    N_i → l'_L + H'   (hidden brane)

The CP asymmetry ε_i is determined by the Z₃ geometric phases
(Paper 4, §7.5.4):

    ε ≈ 1.6 × 10⁻⁴

(from the Z₃ democratic assignment with δ_CP = −π/2).

The lepton asymmetry from non-thermal production:

    η_L ~ (n_N/s) × ε

where n_N/s is the bulk neutrino number density relative to the
entropy density at production. In the non-thermal scenario:

    n_N/s ~ Br(inf→NN) × T_reh / M_N

For Br ~ 2.8 × 10⁻³ and T_reh/M_N ~ 5×10⁹/10¹⁴ ~ 5×10⁻⁵:

    n_N/s ~ 2.8 × 10⁻³ × 5×10⁻⁵ ~ 1.4×10⁻⁷

## 5.4 The Baryon Asymmetry (Before Washout)

After sphaleron conversion (28/79):

    η_B^{(0)} = (28/79) × η_L = 0.354 × n_N/s × ε

    = 0.354 × 1.4×10⁻⁷ × 1.6×10⁻⁴

    = 0.354 × 2.2×10⁻¹¹

    ≈ **8 × 10⁻¹²**

This is a factor of ~75 below the observed η_B = 6×10⁻¹⁰. The
shortfall is resolved by the resonant enhancement (§5.5) and after
accounting for washout (§5.6).

## 5.5 The Resonant Enhancement

The shortfall is resolved by the resonant leptogenesis enhancement
(Pilaftsis & Underwood 2004). The three bulk neutrinos, localized
at the three Z₃ fixed points of CP², have masses split by the
warp factor:

    M_i = M_0 × e^{−k φ_i}

For small splitting |M₂ − M₁|/M₁ ~ e^{−2kπ/3} ~ 10⁻²:

    ε_resonant ≈ ε × M₁ Γ_N / (M₂² − M₁²)

The resonant factor M₁ Γ_N/(M₂²−M₁²) ~ 10–100 (depending on
the exact mass splitting), enhancing η_B by the required factor.
With the washout correction (§5.6), a resonant factor of ~80 is
needed to reach η_B ~ 6×10⁻¹⁰, corresponding to a mass splitting
|M₂−M₁|/M₁ ~ a few × 10⁻³. This should be confirmed from the
Z₃ geometry calculation in Paper 4, §7.5.4.

## 5.6 Washout Calculation

The washout parameter K for non-thermal leptogenesis is:

    K = Γ(N_i → lH) / H|_{T=M_N} = m̃_i / (10⁻³ eV)

where m̃_i = (λ_ν λ_ν†)_{ii} v² / M_i is the effective neutrino
mass (v = 246 GeV, λ_ν is the Yukawa matrix).

From the seesaw formula in natural units (v = 246 GeV,
M_N = 10¹⁴ GeV, m_ν = 0.05 eV = 5 × 10⁻¹¹ GeV):

    λ_ν² = m_ν M_N / v² = (5 × 10⁻¹¹ GeV)(10¹⁴ GeV) / (246 GeV)²
          = 5 × 10³ GeV² / (6 × 10⁴ GeV²) = 0.083

    λ_ν ≈ 0.29

The effective neutrino mass:

    m̃ = λ_ν² v² / M_N = 0.083 × (246)² / 10¹⁴ GeV = 0.05 eV

(As expected — m̃ equals the light neutrino mass m_ν by the seesaw
relation.) The washout parameter:

    K = m̃ / (10⁻³ eV) = 0.05 eV / 10⁻³ eV = 50

K = 50 ≫ 1 is the **strong washout regime**. In this regime, the
lepton asymmetry is suppressed by an efficiency factor:

    η_L^{-1} ≈ 0.3 K / ln K = 0.3 × 50 / ln(50) ≈ 15/3.9 ≈ 3.8

    η_L ≈ 0.26

With this washout factor applied, and including the resonant
enhancement factor of ~80 (§5.5):

    η_B = (28/79) × n_N/s × ε_resonant × η_L
        = 0.354 × 1.4 × 10⁻⁷ × (1.6 × 10⁻⁴ × 80) × 0.26
        ≈ 0.354 × 1.4 × 10⁻⁷ × 1.28 × 10⁻² × 0.26
        ≈ 0.354 × 4.7 × 10⁻¹⁰
        ≈ **1.7 × 10⁻¹⁰**

This is a factor of ~3.5 below the observed η_B = 6 × 10⁻¹⁰. The
remaining discrepancy lies within the uncertainty of the resonant
enhancement factor and the precise off-shell branching ratio. For
Br ~ 10⁻² (upper end of the estimate in §5.2a) and resonant factor
~80:

    η_B ≈ 0.354 × 5 × 10⁻⁷ × 1.28 × 10⁻² × 0.26 ≈ 6 × 10⁻¹⁰ ✓

**Conclusion.** The non-thermal leptogenesis calculation establishes
the framework's consistency with $\eta_B \approx 6 \times 10^{-10}$
at natural parameter values. The computation is an order-of-magnitude
estimate, not a precise prediction. The central GNRRS estimate gives
$\mathrm{Br} \sim 2.8 \times 10^{-3}$, yielding
$\eta_B \sim 1.7 \times 10^{-10}$ — a factor of ~3.5 below observed.
Agreement with the observed value requires either
$\mathrm{Br} \sim 10^{-2}$ (upper end of the off-shell estimate) or
a resonant enhancement factor of ~250 at the central Br, or some
combination. The resonant factor of ~80 used above corresponds to a
mass splitting $|M_2 - M_1|/M_1 \sim \text{a few} \times 10^{-3}$,
which should be confirmed from the Z₃ geometry calculation in Paper 4
§7.5.4. Until that confirmation is in hand, the leptogenesis section
should be understood as showing that: (i) the non-thermal pathway is
open ($T_\mathrm{reh} \ll M_N$ is satisfied), (ii) the required
parameter values (Br, resonant factor) are within the natural range
for the framework's geometry, and (iii) an independent first-principles
determination of the mass splitting from Paper 4 §7.5.4 is needed to
convert this from a consistency check to a prediction. This is flagged
explicitly.

**Sensitivity to T_reh from Paper 7.** The leptogenesis calculation
above uses $T_\mathrm{reh} = 5 \times 10^9\,\text{GeV}$, derived from
$H_\mathrm{inf} \sim 10^{13}\,\text{GeV}$ (§4.0). Paper 7's
inflationary observables ($r \approx 0.001$) imply
$H_\mathrm{inf} \sim 6 \times 10^{13}\,\text{GeV}$, which shifts
$T_\mathrm{reh} \to (1\text{--}2) \times 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$ (a
factor of ~4; see §4.0). Since
$n_N/s \propto \mathrm{Br} \times T_\mathrm{reh}/M_N$, the higher
$T_\mathrm{reh}$ rescales $\eta_B$ upward by the same factor:

At $T_\mathrm{reh} = 1 \times 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$:

$$n_N/s \sim 2.8 \times 10^{-3} \times \frac{10^{10}}{10^{14}} \sim 2.8 \times 10^{-7}$$

$$\eta_B \approx 0.354 \times 2.8 \times 10^{-7} \times (1.6 \times 10^{-4} \times 80) \times 0.26 \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-10}$$

This is within a factor of 2 of the observed $\eta_B = 6 \times 10^{-10}$
with the central Br estimate, without requiring Br at its upper end.
For $\mathrm{Br} \sim 10^{-2}$ at
$T_\mathrm{reh} = 2 \times 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$:

$$\eta_B \approx 0.354 \times 10^{-6} \times 1.28 \times 10^{-2} \times 0.26 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-9}$$

The framework comfortably spans the observed value across the parameter
range. The revised Paper 7 $T_\mathrm{reh}$ relaxes the leptogenesis
tension substantially: agreement with $\eta_B = 6 \times 10^{-10}$ is
achievable with the central Br estimate at the Paper 7 reheating
temperature.

## 5.7 Comparison with Paper 2

Paper 2 (Appendix E) derives η_B through THERMAL leptogenesis with
the 1/ξ² law, assuming the bulk neutrinos are thermally produced.
This paper provides the COMPLEMENTARY non-thermal pathway through
inflaton decay.

The two pathways give consistent answers because:
- Both use the same CP phases (from the Z₃ geometry)
- Both use the same washout dynamics (K = 50 from the seesaw,
  η_L = 0.26 in strong-washout regime)
- The 1/ξ² law applies to the brane asymmetry RATIO regardless of
  whether production is thermal or non-thermal

The non-thermal pathway resolves the tension in Paper 2: the thermal
pathway requires T_reh > M_N ~ 10¹⁴ GeV, which the framework does
not provide. The non-thermal pathway via off-shell inflaton decay
operates at T_reh ~ 5 × 10⁹ GeV — consistent with the framework's
reheating temperature.
