# The Dark Matter-Baryon Ratio, Hubble and Clustering Tensions, and Thirteen Observables from Kaluza-Klein Geometry

## Abstract

We present the complete cosmological predictions of the 5D e-dimension
framework introduced in Paper 1, computed using the CAMB Boltzmann solver
(v1.6.6). The framework fits no free parameters to CMB data. Two observational
inputs — the dark energy density `ρ_Λ` (which fixes the e-circle circumference
`L` in Paper 1) and the dark-to-visible matter ratio `Ω_DM/Ω_b` (which fixes
the brane temperature ratio `ξ` through the scaling law below) — together
with the Standard Model field content, Planck inflation parameters
(inherited unchanged from `ΛCDM`), and a thawing dilaton dark energy equation
of state (`w₀ = −0.85`, `w_a = −0.23`, derived from the Casimir +
Goldberger-Wise potential in Paper 1), determine every cosmological
observable.

The central discovery of this paper is the scaling law — derived from
temperature-asymmetric bulk leptogenesis on the `Z₂` orbifold — that fixes `ξ`:

    Ω_DM / Ω_b = 1/ξ²

where `ξ = T_hidden/T_visible` is the hidden-to-visible brane temperature
ratio. The three bulk right-handed neutrinos (required by the orbifold
Casimir calculation) deposit baryon asymmetries on both branes; the entropy
asymmetry (`1/ξ³`) and washout suppression (`1/ξ²`) combine to give
`η_ratio = 1/ξ⁵`, which reduces to `Ω_DM/Ω_b = 1/ξ²` after multiplying by `ξ³`.
Inverting using the observed ratio `Ω_DM/Ω_b = 5.36` gives `ξ = 0.432` at
leading order. The washout correction — `κ ~ 1/(K ln K)` rather than `1/K` —
introduces a logarithmic factor `f(K,ξ) = ln K / ln(Kξ²)` that shifts the
corrected `ξ` to `≈ 0.49` for the framework's Yukawa coupling (`y ~ 0.45`,
`K ~ 460`). This corrected value converges with the independently
`θ*`-matched `ξ = 0.47`, providing a non-trivial consistency check.

Three scenarios bracket the prediction:

- **Scenario A** (`θ*`-matched, `ξ = 0.47`): `H₀ = 69.5` km/s/Mpc, `S8 = 0.753`,
  `θ*` offset = −0.5" from Planck.
- **Scenario B** (leading-order `1/ξ²` law, `ξ = 0.432`): `H₀ = 68.7` km/s/Mpc,
  `S8 = 0.785`, `θ*` offset = +6.6".
- **Scenario C** (self-consistent `ω_b`, `ξ = 0.4375`): `H₀ = 68.8` km/s/Mpc,
  `S8 = 0.754`, `θ*` offset = +1.0", at the cost of a `~2.5σ` D/H tension.

The complete prediction set, computed by CAMB across all three scenarios:

**Age of the universe:** `t₀ = 13.47–13.60` Gyr — 200–330 Myr younger than
Planck `ΛCDM`, arising from the higher `H₀` predicted by hidden-brane dark
radiation (`ΔN_eff = 6.14 × ξ⁴ = 0.21–0.30`).

**S8 tension resolved:** `S8 = 0.753–0.785`, matching all major weak lensing
surveys (DES Y3: `0.776 ± 0.017`, KiDS-1000: `0.759 ± 0.024`, HSC Y3:
`0.763 ± 0.020`) within `1σ`, resolving the `4σ` discrepancy with Planck `ΛCDM`
(`0.832`). The mechanism: elevated `N_eff` suppresses early clustering, evolving
`w(z)` modifies the growth rate, and lower `Ω_m = 0.290–0.302` directly
reduces `S8`.

**Expansion history:** The thawing dilaton (`w₀ = −0.85`, `w_a = −0.23`) drives
`H(z)` to peak 4–6% above `ΛCDM` at `z ~ 0.3–0.7`, with a specific fingerprint
testable by DESI DR3 at `8σ` significance. The framework prediction lies
within the DESI DR2 `2σ` contour (`w₀ = −0.75`, `w_a = −0.75`) but predicts
milder evolution.

**Sound horizon:** `r_d = 145.8–146.2` Mpc (0.6–0.9% below Planck).

**Neutrino sector:** The bulk seesaw mechanism (Paper 1) predicts
`Σm_ν = 0.06` eV with normal mass ordering from the `Z₃` orbifold geometry,
testable by JUNO within 6 years.

**The cosmic coincidence explained:** `Ω_DM/Ω_b ≈ 5` is no longer a
coincidence — it is a geometric consequence of the two-brane thermal
history. The ratio is `1/ξ²`, where `ξ` is fixed by bulk leptogenesis.

All three scenarios predict `N_eff = 3.31–3.39`, the framework's most
falsifiable near-term prediction. This value is in `3–4σ` tension with
ACT DR6 (`N_eff = 2.86 ± 0.13`), though the combined ACT+SPT+Planck
measurement (`N_eff = 2.81 ± 0.12`) is itself `1.9σ` below the Standard
Model prediction of 3.043, and when SH0ES `H₀` data are included the
preferred value shifts to `N_eff = 3.43 ± 0.13` (Garcia Escudero &
Abazajian 2025) — consistent with the framework. A CAMB computation of
the mirror-sector thermal history shows that mirror `e±` undergo
Boltzmann suppression at BBN (`T_mirror ≈ 0.43` MeV vs `m_e = 0.511` MeV),
producing a time-varying `ΔN_eff`: at recombination, the effective
mirror contribution is `ΔN_eff ≈ 0.36` (`ξ = 0.47`), suppressed by a
factor 0.49 relative to the fully relativistic limit, as the mirror
`e±` annihilate and heat the mirror photon bath — giving total
`N_eff ≈ 3.40`. CMB-S4 (`σ(N_eff) ≈ 0.03`) will confirm or exclude the
mirror sector at `> 9σ`.

CMB-S4 will confirm or exclude the mirror sector at `> 9σ`. DESI DR3 will
test `H(z)` at `8σ`. Euclid will test `S8` at `16σ` relative to Planck `ΛCDM`.
JUNO will test the neutrino mass ordering. The decade 2025–2035 will
decide.
